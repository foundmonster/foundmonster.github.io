<h1 class="homepagename"><b>Receive very interesting things in your email</b></h1>
<br>
I started a newsletter to share things I found during casual or serious internet browsing that I think others may be interested in seeing. <br>

<div class="form-background">
<h3 class="headline"><b>Sign up here:</b></h3>

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/corymalnarick"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://corymalnarick.info/very-interesting-things', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" placeholder="Your Email Address" class="newsletter-email-form" />
  <input 
  	type="submit" 
  	value="Subscribe" 
  	class="newsletter-subscribe-button" />
</form>
