## About Me

I am a designer of digital & service products specializing in systems & user experience design.

My skills in research, analysis, strategy, and design enable a robust approach to crafting exceptional yet simple solutions for complicated, real-world problems that exceed the demands of the market, business, and customer.

I've worked on various assignments ranging from:

- Experience audits of technical, highly targeted e-commerce platforms for enterprise software products and technology
- A complete redesign of an account & order management system for millions of customers
- Research, strategy, and design of products and marketing experiences within e-commerce and physical marketplaces spanning the globe

<p class="home">I currently work at <span><a class="button-link" href="https://apple.com">Apple</a></span> as a UX designer.

I listen to a lot of [music](http://www.last.fm/user/saeglopur), I pursue [photography](https://vsco.co/lostmonster/gallery) as a hobby, and I read [science-fiction and non-fiction books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25281560-cory), among others.
