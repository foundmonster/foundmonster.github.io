title: About
---

<h2 class="subheadwidthtest"> I am a multifunctional designer that works across various creative disciplines in digital & service experiences with a deep expertise in systems thinking & experience design.</h2>

I take a multifaceted approach in my work, applying my skills in research, analysis, strategy, and design to craft real-world solutions for complicated problems that exceed the demands of the market, business, and customer. 

I've worked on various assignments ranging from experience audits of technical enterprise e-commerce platforms, a complete redesign of a customer account & order management system, and research, strategy, and design of brand presences and experiences within global product marketplaces.

I currently work at <a href="https://apple.com">Apple</a> as a UX designer.
