description: Things I want to do with my website.

This page is my personal test of transparently showing my running list of things I need to fix or want to try to do with my website as a means to encourage a fluid process and accomplishment. 

I was inspired by Michael Nielsen's post [_"Using a personal website to enhance your ability to think and create."_](https://mnielsen.github.io/wn/website_enhance.html#fnref4)
