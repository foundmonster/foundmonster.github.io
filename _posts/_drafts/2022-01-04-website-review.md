### **01.** <br> Michael Nielsen's personal website and notebook

I took a lot of inspiration from Michael's writing for my website. My to-do's page is most clear, but my website as a whole and what I plan to do here is motivated by the same rationale. 

### **02.** <br>Tobias Schmidt

This one I like a lot for the simplicity of its design. I clearly took inspiration from this one and others like it in particular. 

I love the use of weight, space, and color to signify hierarchy rather than type size. 

### **03.** <br>Brian Lovin

Brian had a cool website before this iteration, and he really took it to the stratosphere with this one. He explains his rationale at length himself in a blog post, and its pretty nuts! 

He basically created a full web-app for his personal website, complete with accounts and commenting! Its really inspiring stuff.
