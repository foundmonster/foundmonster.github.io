### **Introduction:**<br>In the Long Run, We're All Dead

- The average human lifespan is absurdly short.
    - If you live to be eighty, its about four thousand weeks.
    - We've been granted mental capacities to make almost infinitely ambitious plans, yet practically no time at all to put them into action. 
- It follows from this that time management should be everyone's chief concern. Arguably, time management is all life is. 
    - Yet the modern discipline known as time management––like its hipper cousin, productivity––is a depressingly narrow-minded affair, focused on how to crank through as many work tasks as possible, or on devising the perfect morning routine, or on cooking all your dinners for the week in one big batch on Sundays.
    - These things matter, but they're hardly all that matters.
    - The world is full of wonder. 
    - Good luck finding a time-management system that makes any room for engaging productively with your fellow citizens, with current events, or with the fate of the environment. 
- This book is an attempt to help redress the balance––to see if we can't discover, or recover, some ways of thinking about time that do justice to our real situation: to the outrageous brevity and shimmering possibilities of our four thousand weeks.

Life on the Conveyor Belt

- Nobody these days needs telling that there isn't enough time. 
- And yet busyness is really only the beginning. 
    - Many other complaints are about our limited time. 
        - Daily battle against online distraction
        - Languishing in a dull job, or not employed at all, is even more distressing because you're using up your limited time in a way you'd rather not. 
        - Then there are all those timeles human dilemmas like whom to marry, whether to have children, and what kind of work to pursue. 
            - If we had more time, these would be less agonizing. 
    - Recent events brought matters to a head.
        - In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, many people reported feeling time was disintegrating completely, giving rise to the disorienting impression that their days were somehow simultaneously racing by and dragging on interminably. 
- All of which makes it especially frustrating that so many of us are so bad at managing our limited time. 
    - For years now, we've been deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life. 
    - There are apps and wearable devices for maximizing the payoffs from your workday, your workouts, and even your sleep, plus meal replacements to elimitate time wasted eating dinner. 
    - And the chief selling point of a thousand other products and services, from kitchen appliances to online banking, is that they'll help you acheve the widely championed goal of squeezing the most from your time. 
- The problem isn't exactly that these techniques and products don't work. It's that they do work––in that you'll get more done, race to more meetings, ferry your kids to more after-school activities, generate more profit for your employer.
    - And yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious, and somehow emptier as a result. 
    - American anthropologist Edward T. Hall pointed out that time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new tasks as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming "more productive" just seems to cause the belt to speed up.
- This is the maddening truth about time, which most advice on managing time seems to miss. 
    - The more you struggle to control it, to make it conform to your agenda, the further it slips from your control. 
    - Consider all the technology intended to help us gain the upper hand over time: in a world with dishwashers, microwaves, and jet engines, time ought to feel _more_ expansive and abundant, thanks to all the hours freed up. 
        - But this is nobody's actual experience. 
        - Instead, life accelerates, and everyone grows more impatient. 
- The same self-defeating pattern applies to many of our attempts to become more productive at work. 
    - A few years ago, drowning in email, I successfully implemented the system known as Inbox Zero. 
    - I soon discovered that when you get tremendously efficient at answering email, all that happens is that you get much more email. 
- None of this is how the future was supposed to feel. 
    - In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that within a century, no one would have to work more than 15 hours a week. 
    - The challenge would be how to fill all our newfound leisure time without going crazy. 
- Keynes was wrong. 
    - When people make enough money to meet their needs, they just find new things to need and new lifestyles to aspire to. 
    - Whenever they reach that lifestyle, they nominate new lifestyles with whom to try to keep up. 
    - They work harder and harder, and soon busyness becomes an emblem of prestige. 
    - Moreover, the busyness of the better-off is contagious, because one extremely effective way to make more money for those at the top of the tree is to cut costs and make efficiency improvements in their companies and industries. 
    - Busyness at the top forces busyness throughout to the bottom for everyone. 

On Getting the Wrong Things Done

- Here, we get to the heart of things: the sense that despite all this activity, even the relatively privileged among us rarely get around to doing the right things. 
    - We sense a wrongness in that there are more important things to be doing with our time, yet we spend our time doing other things instead.
- Our attempts to be more productive exacerbates this feeling of wrongness.
    - We "get through" tasks in order to "get them out of the way" with the result that we live mentally in the future waiting for when we'll finally get around to what really matters––and worrying in the meantime that we don't measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. 
- Increasing productivity may serve _someone's_ interests––this turns us into better cogs in the economic machine. 
    - But it doesn't result in peace of mind, or lead us to spend more of our finite time on those people and things we care most deeply about ourselves. 
- _Four Thousand Weeks_ is yet another book about making the best use of time.
    - But it is written in the belief that time management as we know it has failed miserably, and that we need to stop pretending otherwise.
    - Productivity is a trap. 
        - Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster. 
    - The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control. 
        - Let's start by admitting defeat: this is never going to happen.
- That's _excellent_ news.
