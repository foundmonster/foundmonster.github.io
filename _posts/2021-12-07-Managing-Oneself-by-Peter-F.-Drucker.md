This book was [originally a long article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/managing-oneself) in the Harvard Business Review. 

I recently discovered its book version from a list of recommendations of materials on career maintenance. I resonated with its message a lot. I thought that it does a great job structuring and communicating what to self-evaluate and how to do it in a clear and effective way that I haven't seen otherwise. 

I take notes in an outline format when I find short action-oriented books like this so I can refer back to its message and take action over time. 

Below I've provided that outline in full so others may read, understand, and use its message.

- **What are my strengths?**
	- Feedback Analysis
		- For all key decisions or key actions, write down what you expect will happen. 
		- 9-12 months later, compare the results with your expectations. 
	- Action that follows feedback analysis:
		- **Concentrate on your strengths**
		<br>Put yourself where your strengths produce results.
		- **Work on improving your strengths**<br> 
		Analysis will quickly show where you need to improve, acquire new skills, and show the gaps in knowledge that can be filled. 
		- **Discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it**<br>
		Acquire skills you need to filly realize your strengths.
		- **Remedy bad habits**
		<br>Remedy the things you do or fail to do that inhibit your effectiveness and performance. These will quickly show up in feedback analysis. 
		- **Remedy bad manners**<br>
		Saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a person’s name or asking after their family enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. When bright people fail as soon as coordination with others is required, it indicates lack of courtesy – that is, lack of manners. 
	- Feedback analysis reveals **what not to do** by showing areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre. In those areas, a knowledge worker should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. Waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. 
<br>
- **How do I Perform?**
	- Determine if you are a reader or a listener.
		- Few people know that there are readers and listeners and that people are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they are. Few listeners can be made readers, and few readers can be made listeners. 
	- Determine how you learn.
  	- Methods of learning: listening, reading, writing, talking. 
  	- Easiest to acquire among all the important pieces of self-knowledge, but few people act on this. 
  	- Acting on this is key to performance. 
	- Determine if you work well with people, or if you are a loner.
  	- If you work well with people, in what relationship? 
  	- Some work best as subordinates. George Patton is a great subordinate. 
  	- Some work best as teammates; others work best alone; some are exceptionally talented coaches and mentors; others are incompetent as mentors.
	- Determine if you produce results as a decision maker or as an advisor.
  	- Many perform best as advisors, but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. 
  	- Many need an advisor to force themselves to think, then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-confidence, and courage. 
	- Determine if you perform well under stress, or do you need a highly structured and predictable environment.
	- Determine if you work best in a big or small organization
  	- Few work well in all kinds of environments. 
  - Do not try to change yourself. You are unlikely to succeed.
  - Work hard to improve the way you perform.
<br>
- **What are my values?**
	- A person’s values must be compatible with the organization’s values in order to be effective.
	- Ethics is only one part of a value system.
	- To determine your ethics, simply ask yourself what kind of person you want to see in the mirror in the morning.
	- A person's strengths should fit with their value system.
<br>
- **Where do I belong?**
	- Answering What are my strengths?, How do I Perform?, and What are my values? shows where someone belongs and doesn’t belong.
	- Knowing the answers to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, but this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be structured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the inds of results you shoud expect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am.”
	- Successful careers are not planned. 
	- They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. 
	- Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person into an outstanding performer.

- **What should I contribute?**
	- To answer this, address three distinct elements: 
		1. What does the situation require? 
		2. Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my alues, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? 
		3. Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? 
	- Brief case study to help explain: 
		- Newly appointed hospital administrator of a hospital that has been coasting on their reputation for 30 years. 
		- They decide their contribution should be to establish a standard of excellence in the ER within two years because the ER was big, visible, and sloppy. 
		- They decided every patient should be seen by a qualified nurse within 60 seconds. 
		- Within 12 months, the ER had become a model for all hospitals in the US, and within another two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. 
	- As this example suggests, it is rarely possible to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and specific. 
	- The answer to this question must balance several things. 
		1. Results should be hard to achieve – they should require “stretching,” but they should be within reach.
		2. Results should be meaningful. they should make a difference. 
		3. Results should be visible and measurable. 
	- From this, develop a course of action: 
		1. What do do, 
		2. Where and how to start, and 
		3. What goals and deadlines to set.

- **Responsibility for relationships**
	- Managing yourself requires taking responsibility for relationships in two parts. 
		- **Accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are.**
			- They have their own strengths, ways of getting things done, their own values. To be effective, know the strengths, performance modes, and values of your coworkers. 
			- Working relationships are as much based on the people as they are on the work.
		- **Take responsibility for communication**
			- It is your responsibility to make sure everyone understands your goals, how you work, and what you expect of yourself and of each other. 
			- Tell your associates, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be expected to deliver.”
				- Whenever someone tells their associates this, the response is always, “This is most helpful, but why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
			- Always ask your associates, “What do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?”
			- Organizations are no longer built on force, but on trust. 
			- This doesnt mean everyone likes eachother; this means they understand eachother.

- **The second half of your life**
	- Managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career.
		- After doing 20 years of doing the same thing, people are very good at their jobs.
		- But they are not learning, contributing, deriving challenge, or satisfied with the job anymore.
		- And they are likely to face another 20-25 years of work. 
	- Three ways to develop a second career.
		1. **Start one.**
			- Might take no more than moving from one org to another. controller of a large corp becomes controller of a medium-sized hospital.
			- Others go back to school – at 45, going back to law school.
		2. **Develop a parellel career.**
		- While working in your first career, create a parallel job.
		3. **Social entrepreneurs**
			- These are people with very successful first careers. They love their work, but it no longer chalenges them. 
			- They keep doing what they have been doing, but spend less time on it. 
			- And also start another activity, usually a nonprofit. 
	- People that manage second half of life are always going to be the minority.
	- Many people retire on the job by counting the years until their retirement.
	- **Prerequisite for managing second half of your life: must begin long before you enter it.**
		- Those that don’t volunteer before they are 40 rarely volunteer after 60.
		- Begin working on second enterprise long before reaching peak in original business.
			- Important to start working on it early because you can never be more prepared for big life events during which a second enterprise will significantly help you.
