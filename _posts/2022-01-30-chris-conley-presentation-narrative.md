One of [Chris Conley's](https://abundantprofessional.com) recent newsletters outlined a great presentation framework for innovative ideas. 

The framework is: 
1. Share an experience
2. Highlight the challenge
3. Share insights from your work about the challenge
4. Share the solution built on the insights
5. Articulate benefits of the solution
6. Warn of the consequences of not pursuing the solution
7. Ask for specific support

In his own words: 

>Reading through that you can feel a narrative. Each section has a purpose. Each section relates to the next. It ends with a specific call to action for the audience, not an open-ended, “whaddya think?”
>Use this structure and I guarantee you will have better results. You’ll either receive a quicker “no” or a specific level of support that keeps things moving.
And your presentation can actually be 7 slides. You can get through it in 10 to 15 minutes - not 62 minutes with no time for discussion. :)
>It takes intention and practice. But it is easy to get started.
>Do you have a presentation you have to give to get support, investment or approval? Then write it out using this structure. Build a short slide deck around it using simple, powerful visuals. Practice the delivery to a couple colleagues. Tune both the specific points themselves and how you transition between them.
>It is fun and empowering to use such a simple but effective framework.
