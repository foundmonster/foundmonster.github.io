Over the past week and a half, I tried to build a habit of collecting interesting things with a bookmark organization tool to then be sorted, saved, and potentially shared. 

It does a few things at once: helps me manage the organization of my internet reading and browsing information, and helps create an easy system to compile and share the things I want to share from the list. 

I've been using Raindrop and it works really well. Links I want to save go into the unsorted bucket and at some point in the future I simply go through this list one by one and organize them into the appropriate folder. 

Below is a list of six of the most interesting things from my internet browsing and newsletters of the past weekish of time: 

- [How Smart UX teams structure their hiring interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/structured-hiring-interviews/?utm_source=Alertbox&utm_campaign=149fafcbcc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_12_08_52_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_7f29a2b335-149fafcbcc-40363729)
