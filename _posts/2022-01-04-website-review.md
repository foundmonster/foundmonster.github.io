### **01.** <br> [Michael Nielsen's personal website and notebook](https://mnielsen.github.io/index.html)

I took a lot of inspiration from Michael's writing for my website. Publishing a to-dos page is a direct example, but what I plan to do here overall is inspired by what he's said as well.

He is a scientist by trade, helping pioneer quantum computing. A lot of his work is way over my head, like his [most recent post on actual, real-world warp drives](https://mnielsen.github.io/wn/warp_drive.html). 

But when it comes to meta-analysis of writing and websites in general, he has some very interesting thoughts that is legible to people without a quantum physics background. 

He goes at length explaining principles behind publishing notes on a personal website. For instance: 

> - The purpose of the site is to help me think well. This purpose is in opposition to many widely-used norms in online writing. I suspect that the possible upside is a lot higher than I have (naively) historically thought.
> - Committed writing – the sort written in blood – is an exceptional method of self-transformation.
> - Each piece here should durably level up my understanding. This does not mean it won’t also be a transitory part of some longer game.
> - I think better when the stakes are higher. One way to raise the stakes is to share work with people whose good opinion I desire.

He also provides a great argument for the value of design that struck a chord with me. 

Professionally, design is hard to sell. Its value is opaque, sometimes comprised of small, incremental changes to the business' bottom line over the course of long periods of time. 

Its an up-front investment without an immediate lump-sum return. Its something you have to not only have a skillset to implement, but also have a skill set to track and measure. Its unfair, to be honest. 

There are tools to make it easier, but it isn't wholesale. Good design might be easy to acquire or learn through osmosis through the various web and app templates flying about, but the ***reasons why*** behind certain decisions,  how to make your own design decisions as a business to stand out, measure problems, and fix them is not easy to understand. Research and strategy is an entire industry on its own alongside visual design. 

That's a long sidebar. For personal websites, and for designers in particular, 

> [A well designed website] makes the writer’s experience better. In particular, improving the design can be a way of enhancing your ability to think and create. When you invest time in the design, when something looks and feels beautiful, you take it more seriously yourself.

Thinking about a personal website this way is very interesting and I will be trying this out.

This one I like a lot for the simplicity of its design. I took inspiration from this one in particular and others like it that I may share in another post. 

I love the use of weight, space, and color to signify hierarchy rather than type size. 

### **03.** <br>[Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com)

Brian had a cool website before this iteration, and he really took it to the stratosphere with this one. He explains his rationale at length himself in a [blog post](https://brianlovin.com/writing/the-shape-of-software), and its pretty nuts! 

He basically created a full web-app for his personal website, complete with accounts and commenting! Its really inspiring stuff.
